The minimum image size you should design is 57 × 57 pixels (or 114 × 114 pixels for high resolution). It is OK to design a larger image because the iPhone automatically resizes it for you. In general, try to design a larger image because doing so prepares your application for the newer devices that Apple may roll out.

The easiest way to add a splash screen is to add an image named Default.png to the Resources folder of your Xcode project. This image must be sized 480 × 320 pixels (or 960 × 640 pixels for high resolution).

When adding an image to the Resources folder in your Xcode project, why do you need to check the “Copy items into destination group’s folder (If needed)” option?

This is to ensure that the image is always copied into the Resources folder. If not, Xcode only makes a reference to the image; it is not physically in the Resources folder.
